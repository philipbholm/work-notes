General 
- Do not use abstract nouns
- Avoid displaced actors
- Use chronological sequence of events
- Keep relevant parts of the sentence together (disjoined)

Principles of clear writing
- The subjects of the sentences name the cast of characters
- The verbs that go with those subjects name the crucial actions those characters are a part of
- Keep subjects consistent over a sequence of sentences

How to fix unclear writing?
- Locate characters and the actions those perform
- Make sure characters are subjects and actions are verbs
- A quick method is simply to run a line under the first five or six words of every sentence. If you find that (1) you have to go more than six or seven words into a senÂ­tence to get past the subject to the verb and (2) the subject of the sentence is not one of your characters, take a hard look at that sentence; its characters and actions probably do not align with subjects and verbs.
