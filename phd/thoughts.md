- Finally, either of the techniques described here (replicated secret sharing or Shamir’s secret sharing) only guarantee privacy in the case where a majority of the servers are honest (for instance, 2 out of 3) and can therefore not be used in the very important case of secure two-party computation, or in general in multiparty computation where you don’t trust any of the other participants (also known as self-trust).

- While active security is preferable in practice, there are some notable examples in which passive security might be sufficient. First, if there is any way of making sure that the code can’t be changed (e.g. you ship your MPC protocol in some hardened hardware device) then passive security might be enough. Moreover, there are cases in which MPC is needed, not so much because you don’t trust who you are working with, but maybe just because due to legal requirements you are not allowed to access some data, yet you are legally allowed to learn the result of some computations performed on it (think of some researcher performing statistics on sensitive personal data). In this case, implementing a passively secure MPC solution might still be enough to comply with existing regulations and in particular to assure that you never had access to any data you were not supposed to access.

- Side channel attacks by the parent instance might be infutile since a binary data blob is sent in and a result is sent out
