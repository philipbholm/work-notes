# Goal
Create the best platform for training and running ML-models on health data.

Researchers will use our platform because they can get access to data without any tooling contraints. 


## Subgoals 
- Gather as much high quality data as possible for every clinical registry. Aim to store all raw data 
- Let owners of clinical registries add project metadata to a searchable database where approved researchers can search and ask for access
	- Access to synthetic data can be given first
	- Can give access to data characteristics (distribution, number of missing values, etc)
	- Combining different data sources (very hard today)
- It should not be necesarry for researchers to develop locally. Give access to all the necessary tooling and compute
